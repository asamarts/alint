All notable changes to alint are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.8] — 2026-04-26

Three new output formats. Brings the count to seven and
closes the v0.5 output-format roadmap item. Schema-compatible:
every v0.5.7 config runs unchanged.

### Added

- **`--format markdown`** (alias `md`) — GitHub-Flavored
  Markdown suited to PR comments, mkdocs report pages, and
  Slack via webhook bridges. H1 banner + one-line summary
  (`**N violations across M files** (E errors, W warnings)`)
  + one H2 section per file with bulleted violations + a
  trailing "Cross-file" section for path-less / cross-file
  violations. Output is byte-deterministic so PR-comment
  workflows can diff alint output across runs without
  spurious churn. `alint fix --format markdown` gets a
  dedicated renderer too — lists each rule's items with
  `applied` / `skipped` / `unfixable` status.

- **`--format junit`** (alias `junit-xml`) — the de-facto-
  standard CI test-report XML consumed by Jenkins, Azure
  DevOps, GitHub's `dorny/test-reporter`, and GitLab CI's
  JUnit integration. Common-denominator schema: a single
  `<testsuites>` wrapping a single `<testsuite name="alint">`,
  with one `<testcase>` per (rule, file/path-less-bucket).
  Passing rules contribute self-closed testcases; each
  violation becomes a testcase with a `<failure>` whose
  `type` attribute carries the alint level (`error` /
  `warning` / `info`) so consumers can filter
  level-specifically. XML 1.0-illegal control characters
  are stripped on the way out.

- **`--format gitlab`** (aliases `gitlab-codequality`,
  `code-quality`) — GitLab CI's native Code Quality JSON,
  which is the upstream Code Climate "Issue" specification.
  One issue object per violation:
  `{ description, check_name, fingerprint, severity,
  location: { path, lines: { begin } } }`. Severity
  mapping: `Error → major`, `Warning → minor`,
  `Info → info`. Fingerprint is the SHA-256 hex of
  `rule_id|path|message` — the line number is intentionally
  omitted so a violation that drifts up or down by a few
  lines stays the same issue across runs. Path-less /
  cross-file violations emit `location.path = "."`
  (repository root) so the report still validates against
  the GitLab schema.

### Internal

- `alint-output` gains a `sha2` dep for the GitLab
  fingerprint (already a workspace dep used by
  `alint-rules` + `alint-dsl`).
- 38 new unit tests across the three formatters cover empty
  reports, level-mapping, cross-file edge cases,
  determinism, special-character escaping, and (for
  GitLab) fingerprint stability across line-drift +
  sensitivity to message changes.

## [0.5.7] — 2026-04-26

Competitive bench publication. The v0.5.6 harness becomes a
multi-tool driver: alint, ls-lint, Repolinter, and `find` +
`ripgrep` pipelines all run against the same synthetic
trees on the same hardware, producing wall-time numbers
that are directly comparable. Reproducibility via a new
`ghcr.io/asamarts/alint-bench` Docker image (every
competitor pinned by version) and an `xtask bench-scale
--docker` flag that re-execs the bench inside the image.
Schema-compatible; every v0.5.6 config runs unchanged.

### Added

- **`xtask bench-scale --tools <list>`** — the bench
  harness now runs an arbitrary set of tools across the
  same `(size × scenario × mode)` matrix v0.5.6
  introduced. Default `alint` (preserves the v0.5.6
  publication shape), `all` expands to every known tool,
  comma lists pick a subset (`alint,grep`,
  `alint,ls-lint`). Tools missing on `PATH` are
  log-and-dropped at resolve time so a partial
  installation still produces alint-only rows without
  aborting.
  - **alint** — full matrix (every scenario × mode).
  - **ls-lint** — gated to (S1, full); ls-lint is
    extension/case-class only and has no
    `--changed`-equivalent.
  - **Repolinter** — gated to (S2, full); pinned to
    0.11.2 (last pre-archive release, repo archived
    2026-02-06). The size-bound check (no files >10 MiB)
    is dropped: Repolinter has no built-in primitive
    and emulating via `script` rules would distort
    timings beyond recognition.
  - **find + ripgrep pipeline** (`grep`) — gated to
    (S1, full) and (S2, full); shell-pipeline baseline
    representing the small-team "we just chain `find`
    and `rg`" status quo. S3's cross-file rules have no
    sane shell expression and are out of scope.

- **`bench/Dockerfile` + `ghcr.io/asamarts/alint-bench`
  image** — the canonical competitive-bench environment.
  Built and pushed by `.github/workflows/bench-docker.yml`
  on tag pushes (`:<ver>` + `:latest`), main pushes
  (`:edge`), and manual dispatch. Pinned versions of
  hyperfine, ripgrep, repolinter, ls-lint, Node 20, and
  the Rust toolchain so a given image tag IS the bench
  environment for that release.

- **`xtask bench-scale --docker`** — re-execs the bench
  inside the published image. Bind-mounts the workspace
  at `/work`, uses a named volume for the cargo target
  dir so target/ artefacts persist across runs without
  shadowing the host. Image override via
  `ALINT_BENCH_IMAGE=...`.

- **First competitive numbers** under
  `docs/benchmarks/v0.5/scale/linux-x86_64/`. Same
  fingerprint as v0.5.6's alint-only publication; rows
  for ls-lint / repolinter / grep added at the
  scenarios + sizes each tool supports. Headline
  ratios (linux-x86_64, 100k files):
  - **S1 (filename hygiene)**: alint vs ls-lint vs
    `find | grep` pipelines.
  - **S2 (existence + content)**: alint vs Repolinter
    vs `find` + `rg` pipelines.
  - **S3 (workspace bundle)**: alint only — no
    competitor models cross-file rules.

  Per-row markdown plus a `results.json` with the full
  matrix; the new `Tool` column makes pivoting trivial.

- **Published 1M-file numbers** under
  `docs/benchmarks/v0.5/scale/linux-x86_64/1m/results.md`.
  Six rows (`1m × {S1,S2,S3} × {full,changed}`) on the
  same hardware as v0.5.6's 1k/10k/100k publication.
  Headlines: 1m / S1 / full ≈ 3.5s, 1m / S2 / full ≈ 10s,
  1m / S3 / full ≈ 9.5min — the cross-file rules in the
  workspace bundle scale superlinearly with N, exactly as
  the methodology predicted. `--changed` saves ~34% on
  S2's content rules at 1m but barely helps S3 (cross-file
  rules can't be filtered).

- **Auto-reduced sampling at 1m**. The harness caps
  `1m`-row warmup at 1 and measured runs at 3 regardless
  of `--warmup` / `--runs`. A single `1m / S3` invocation
  runs for several minutes; thirteen of them per row would
  push the matrix to many hours. The trade-off is wider
  stddev at 1m — `methodology.md` is updated to flag this
  so readers don't compare 1m's stddev to the smaller-size
  rows like-for-like. Stddev is reported as `0.0` when
  hyperfine emits `null` (single-run rows) instead of
  failing the whole bench.

### Fixed

- **`--include-1m` now actually adds the 1m size** to the
  matrix when `--sizes` is at its default (1k,10k,100k).
  Previously the flag only filtered 1m out unless you
  also retyped the size list — the opposite of what the
  help text implied.

- **Tool-version fingerprint stays one line**. Multi-line
  `--version` banners (notably ripgrep's) were being
  stored verbatim in the fingerprint's `tool_versions`
  map, blowing up the rendered "**Tools:** ..." line in
  committed reports. Capture now keeps just the first
  line of each tool's `--version` output.

## [0.5.6] — 2026-04-26

Scale-ceiling bench publication + a latent walker bug fix
that the bench surfaced. New `xtask bench-scale` subcommand
runs alint across a (size × scenario × mode) matrix with
hardware-fingerprint capture and JSON + Markdown
publication; v0.5.7 layers competitive comparisons
(ls-lint, Repolinter, find/grep) on top of the same
infrastructure. Schema-compatible; every v0.5.5 config
runs unchanged.

## [0.5.6] — 2026-04-26

Scale-ceiling bench publication + a latent walker bug fix
that the bench surfaced. New `xtask bench-scale` subcommand
runs alint across a (size × scenario × mode) matrix with
hardware-fingerprint capture and JSON + Markdown
publication; v0.5.7 will layer competitive comparisons
(ls-lint, Repolinter, find/grep) on top of the same
infrastructure. Schema-compatible; every v0.5.5 config
runs unchanged.

### Added

- **`xtask bench-scale`** — scale-ceiling benchmark
  driver. Runs alint across:
  - **Sizes**: `1k` / `10k` / `100k` (default), opt into
    `1m` via `--include-1m`. Synthetic monorepo trees
    generated deterministically from the seed
    (default `0xa11e47`).
  - **Scenarios**: `S1` (filename hygiene, 8 rules) /
    `S2` (existence + content, 8 rules) / `S3` (workspace
    bundle: `oss-baseline` + `rust` + `monorepo` +
    `monorepo/cargo-workspace`).
  - **Modes**: `full` (every file evaluated) and
    `changed` (`alint check --changed` against a
    deterministic 10% diff — measures the v0.5.0
    incremental path).

  Per-row hyperfine measurement (3 warmup + 10 measured
  runs by default); JSON + Markdown output under
  `docs/benchmarks/v0.5/scale/<os>-<arch>/`. Hardware
  fingerprint (CPU model + cores, RAM, FS type, kernel,
  rustc, alint version + git SHA, hyperfine version)
  embedded in every report so cross-machine comparisons
  stay honest.

- **`alint_bench::tree::generate_monorepo`** — new
  Cargo-workspace-shaped synthetic-tree generator with
  real workspace `[workspace]` + per-package
  `[package].name` Cargo.toml content (so the
  `monorepo/cargo-workspace@v1` ruleset's structured-query
  rules see well-formed manifests). Full determinism for
  byte-identical trees across platforms.

- **`alint_bench::tree::select_subset`** — deterministic
  Fisher-Yates partial shuffle for picking a fraction of
  files to "touch" in `--changed`-mode benches.

- **First published numbers**:
  `docs/benchmarks/v0.5/scale/linux-x86_64/` with 18 rows
  (3 sizes × 3 scenarios × 2 modes) on AMD Ryzen 9 3900X /
  62 GB / ext4 / Linux 6.1. Companion
  `docs/benchmarks/v0.5/scale/{README.md,methodology.md}`
  documents the harness + scenario definitions + how to
  reproduce.

- **CLI flags**: `--sizes`, `--scenarios`, `--modes`,
  `--warmup`, `--runs`, `--seed`, `--diff-pct`, `--out`,
  `--include-1m`, `--quick`, `--json-only`. The default
  (`cargo xtask bench-scale` with no args) produces the
  full publication-grade matrix.

### Fixed

- **Walker no longer descends into `.git/`.** `alint
  check` against a tree containing a `.git/` directory
  used to walk into git's internal storage — wasted work
  for every alint rule (none of them target
  `.git/objects/*`) and a TOCTOU hazard during git's
  auto-gc / packfile rewrites. The walker now adds
  `.git` to its exclusion overrides unconditionally.
  No user-visible behaviour change for repos whose
  `.gitignore` already covers `.git/`-shaped paths;
  benchmark and large-monorepo runs become both faster
  and reliable.

### Internal

- New `xtask/src/bench/` module: `mod.rs` (orchestration
  + types), `fingerprint.rs` (hardware capture per OS),
  `scenarios/*.yml` (S1/S2/S3 alint configs embedded via
  `include_str!`).
- `xtask` gains `serde` (with `derive`) and `serde_json`
  dev-deps for hyperfine `--export-json` parsing and the
  results.json schema.
- 11 new unit tests on `alint_bench::tree` covering the
  monorepo shape, file-count exactness, deterministic
  output for the same seed, and `select_subset`'s
  fraction / clamping / determinism semantics.

### Compatibility

- Schema version remains `1`. No rule-config changes.
- Public API additions are non-breaking. Walker
  `.git/`-exclusion is a behaviour fix, not a config
  change.

## [0.5.5] — 2026-04-26

Two license-compliance bundled rulesets — the v0.5 cycle's
expansion beyond the workspace-tier monorepo audience to
OSS maintainers and corporate-policy teams.
Schema-compatible; every v0.5.4 config runs unchanged.

### Added

- **`alint://bundled/compliance/reuse@v1`** — FSFE
  [REUSE Specification](https://reuse.software/)
  compliance. Three rules covering the spec's two
  load-bearing requirements:
  - `reuse-licenses-dir-exists` — top-level `LICENSES/`
    directory present (per
    [§ License files](https://reuse.software/spec/#license-files)).
  - `reuse-source-has-spdx-identifier` — every source
    file carries an `SPDX-License-Identifier:` header in
    its first ~10 lines.
  - `reuse-source-has-copyright-text` — every source
    file carries an `SPDX-FileCopyrightText:` header.

  Source-file rules cover the common code extensions
  (`*.{rs,py,js,jsx,ts,tsx,go,java,kt,c,cc,cpp,h,hpp,
  hh,sh,rb,swift}`) and exclude vendored / build /
  dist directories. Projects that license files via
  `.license` companions or `REUSE.toml` mappings can
  narrow `paths:` on the source rules.

  ```yaml
  extends:
    - alint://bundled/compliance/reuse@v1
  ```

- **`alint://bundled/compliance/apache-2@v1`** —
  compliance for projects distributed under the Apache
  License, Version 2.0. Three rules verifying the
  artefacts the license text itself requires of
  redistributors:
  - `apache-2-license-text-present` — LICENSE (or
    LICENSE.md / LICENSE.txt / COPYING) contains the
    canonical "Apache License, Version 2.0" text.
  - `apache-2-notice-file-exists` — root NOTICE file
    present (per Apache-2.0 §4(d)).
  - `apache-2-source-has-license-header` — every source
    file carries the canonical "Licensed under the
    Apache License, Version 2.0" header in its first
    ~25 lines.

  Substring-matches the canonical license title rather
  than doing full bit-for-bit comparison, so SPDX
  templates, apache.org's template, and GitHub's
  auto-init all parse as compliant. Dual-licensed
  projects (e.g. Apache-2.0 OR MIT) can extend this
  ruleset and use `level: off` on rules they don't want
  firing strictly.

  Bundled catalog: 15 → 17.

### Internal

- New ruleset directory
  `crates/alint-dsl/rulesets/v1/compliance/` with two
  `.yml` files; registered in
  `alint_dsl::bundled::REGISTRY`. Neither ruleset uses a
  fact gate — adopting a compliance ruleset is the
  user's signal that the project intends to be
  compliant with the named scheme.
- 6 new e2e scenarios under
  `crates/alint-e2e/scenarios/check/bundled-compliance/`:
  per ruleset, happy-path + missing-core-artefact +
  missing-source-header.

### Compatibility

- Schema version remains `1`. Pure config — no new rule
  kinds, no new core APIs.
- JSON / SARIF / GitHub outputs byte-equivalent for
  configs that don't extend the new rulesets.

## [0.5.4] — 2026-04-26

`alint init` — the missing one-line adoption story.
Detects the repo's ecosystem (Rust / Node / Python / Go /
Java) and optionally its workspace shape (Cargo / pnpm /
Yarn-or-npm), then writes a `.alint.yml` extending the
right bundled rulesets. Closes the v0.5 monorepo theme on
the adoption side: every primitive shipped in v0.5.0–v0.5.3
now has a one-line on-ramp. Schema-compatible; every v0.5.3
config runs unchanged.

### Added

- **`alint init [PATH]`** — new subcommand. Detects the
  repo's ecosystem from root manifests and writes a
  `.alint.yml` with `extends:` lines for
  `oss-baseline@v1` plus each detected language ruleset.
  Detection is deliberately a presence check (file
  exists, no parsing) so it stays fast and predictable:
  - Rust: `Cargo.toml`
  - Node: `package.json`
  - Python: `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` / `setup.cfg`
  - Go: `go.mod`
  - Java: `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` / `build.gradle.kts`

  Refuses to overwrite an existing config (any of
  `.alint.yml` / `.alint.yaml` / `alint.yml` /
  `alint.yaml`) — exits non-zero with a clear message
  pointing the user at deletion.

- **`alint init --monorepo`** — adds workspace detection
  on top of the language scan. Recognises:
  - **Cargo workspaces** — root `Cargo.toml` contains a
    `[workspace]` table (line-prefix check, no TOML
    parsing).
  - **pnpm workspaces** — root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` /
    `.yml` exists.
  - **Yarn / npm workspaces** — root `package.json`
    contains `"workspaces"`.

  When a workspace is detected, the generated config also
  extends `monorepo@v1` and the matching
  `monorepo/<flavor>-workspace@v1` overlay, plus sets
  `nested_configs: true` so each subdirectory can layer
  its own `.alint.yml` on top.

  ```yaml
  # `alint init --monorepo` in a Cargo workspace produces:
  version: 1
  nested_configs: true

  extends:
    - alint://bundled/oss-baseline@v1
    - alint://bundled/rust@v1
    - alint://bundled/monorepo@v1
    - alint://bundled/monorepo/cargo-workspace@v1
  ```

  Bazel / Lerna / Nx / Turbo detection deferred — the
  three flavours that have bundled overlays cover the
  workspace-tier sweet spot.

### Internal

- New `crates/alint/src/init.rs` module with `Detection` /
  `Language` / `WorkspaceFlavor` types, a pure `detect()`
  function and a deterministic `render()` emitter. Output
  is hand-formatted YAML (not serialized via serde) so the
  generated file can carry header comments documenting
  what was detected and how to use it.
- 17 new unit tests covering the detector + emitter
  (per-language detection, polyglot repos, workspace
  precedence, header summary).
- 3 new trycmd CLI tests under `tests/cli/init-*.toml`:
  empty-repo init, monorepo-cargo init, refuses-overwrite.
  The trycmd `fs.sandbox = true` mode lets us assert on
  the post-run sandbox state (the generated `.alint.yml`)
  alongside stdout / stderr / exit.
- `help-top-level` snapshot regenerated to include the
  `init` subcommand line.

### Compatibility

- Schema version remains `1`. Pure additive — no rule,
  config, or output changes.
- Public API unchanged (the `init` module is private to
  the binary crate).
- New `tempfile` dev-dependency on `alint` (already a
  workspace dep elsewhere; the binary needs it for the
  init unit tests).

## [0.5.3] — 2026-04-26

Three workspace-aware bundled rulesets layered on top of
`monorepo@v1`. Each is gated by a workspace-flavor fact and
uses the v0.5.2 `when_iter:` filter to scope per-member
checks to actual package directories — `crates/notes/`
(no `Cargo.toml`) or `packages/drafts/` (no `package.json`)
are filtered out without firing false positives.
Schema-compatible; every v0.5.2 config runs unchanged.

### Added

- **`alint://bundled/monorepo/cargo-workspace@v1`** —
  Cargo workspaces. Gated by `facts.is_cargo_workspace`
  (root `Cargo.toml` declares `[workspace]`). Three rules:
  `members = [...]` declared at the workspace root
  (`toml_path_matches`); every `crates/*` directory with
  its own `Cargo.toml` has a README; every member's
  `Cargo.toml` declares `[package].name`.

  ```yaml
  extends:
    - alint://bundled/monorepo@v1
    - alint://bundled/rust@v1
    - alint://bundled/monorepo/cargo-workspace@v1
  ```

- **`alint://bundled/monorepo/pnpm-workspace@v1`** —
  pnpm workspaces. Gated by `facts.is_pnpm_workspace`
  (root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` / `.yml` exists). Three
  rules: `packages: [...]` declared in
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`yaml_path_matches`); every
  `packages/*` with a `package.json` has a README; every
  member's `package.json` declares `name`.

- **`alint://bundled/monorepo/yarn-workspace@v1`** —
  Yarn / npm workspaces (the workspace declaration lives
  in the root `package.json` for both). Gated by
  `facts.is_yarn_workspace` (root `package.json` contains
  `"workspaces"`). Three rules: `workspaces: [...]` is
  non-empty (`json_path_matches` against
  `$.workspaces[*]`); every `{packages,apps}/*` with a
  `package.json` has a README; every member's
  `package.json` declares `name`. Validates the array
  form; the rarer object form
  (`"workspaces": {"packages": [...]}`) is gated by the
  fact but not field-validated here.

  Bundled catalog: 12 → 15 rulesets.

### Internal

- New ruleset directory
  `crates/alint-dsl/rulesets/v1/monorepo/` with three
  `.yml` files; registered in `alint_dsl::bundled::REGISTRY`.
  Each ruleset declares its own `is_*_workspace` fact
  inline rather than promoting them to the core `facts:`
  catalogue — the facts are workspace-specific and not
  meant to be referenced from user configs.
- 7 new e2e scenarios under
  `crates/alint-e2e/scenarios/check/bundled-monorepo/`:
  per-flavor "filters non-member dirs" + "silent outside
  workspace" pair, plus `cargo-workspace`'s "fires on
  missing members" case.

### Compatibility

- Schema version remains `1`. All three rulesets are
  pure config — no new rule kinds, no new core APIs.
- JSON / SARIF / GitHub outputs byte-equivalent for
  configs that don't extend the new rulesets.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-04-26

Per-iteration `when:` filter on iterating rules — closes the
second monorepo-scale gap from the v0.5 roadmap. Combined
with `--changed` (v0.5.0) and `command` plugin (v0.5.1),
this is the third leg of the v0.5 monorepo theme.
Schema-compatible; every v0.5.1 config runs unchanged.

### Added

- **`when_iter:`** field on `for_each_dir`, `for_each_file`,
  and `every_matching_has`. Optional expression evaluated
  against each iterated entry's `iter` context; iterations
  whose verdict is false are skipped before any nested rule
  is built. Closes the Bazel/Cargo/pnpm-workspace gap where
  users previously had to widen `select:` and rely on inner
  rules to short-circuit.

  ```yaml
  - id: workspace-member-has-readme
    kind: for_each_dir
    select: "crates/*"
    when_iter: 'iter.has_file("Cargo.toml")'
    require:
      - kind: file_exists
        paths: "{path}/README.md"
    level: error
  ```

  Without `when_iter:`, `crates/notes/` (no `Cargo.toml`)
  would have fired the missing-README rule. With it, only
  workspace members are evaluated.

- **`iter.*` namespace in `when:` expressions** — exposes
  the iterated entry's metadata to the existing `when:`
  grammar. Same expression compiles in `when_iter:` (outer
  iteration filter) and in any nested rule's `when:`
  (per-iteration nested gate). Outside an iteration
  context, `iter.X` resolves to `null` and
  `iter.has_file(_)` to `false`, matching the
  "missing fact is falsy" convention.

  | Reference | Type | Notes |
  |---|---|---|
  | `iter.path` | string | Relative path of the iterated entry. |
  | `iter.basename` | string | Basename. |
  | `iter.parent_name` | string | Parent dir name. |
  | `iter.stem` | string | Basename minus final extension. |
  | `iter.ext` | string | Final extension without the dot. |
  | `iter.is_dir` | bool | `true` for `for_each_dir`, `false` for `for_each_file`. |
  | `iter.has_file(pattern)` | bool | Glob match relative to the iterated directory. Always `false` on file iteration. |

- **Function-call syntax in the `when:` grammar.** Limited
  to a fixed allow-list of methods on `iter` (currently just
  `has_file`); typos in user configs surface as
  "unknown iter method" parse errors instead of silently
  coercing to `false`. Calls on non-iter namespaces are a
  parse error.

### Internal

- New public types `IterEnv` and `WhenEnv::with_iter()` in
  `alint-core::when`. New `WhenExpr::Call` AST variant.
  `WhenEnv::new()` constructor for callers without
  iteration context.
- Shared parser helper `for_each_dir::parse_when_iter`
  reused by `for_each_file` and `every_matching_has`.
- 9 new unit tests in `alint-core::when` covering the iter
  namespace + function-call grammar + outside-iter
  fallback. 4 new e2e scenarios under
  `crates/alint-e2e/scenarios/check/when_iter/`: marker-file
  filter, basename predicate, recursive-glob predicate,
  composition with `facts.*`.

### Compatibility

- Schema version remains `1`. `when_iter:` is opt-in; rules
  that don't use it behave identically to v0.5.1.
- Public API additions are non-breaking. `WhenEnv` gains an
  `iter: Option<IterEnv>` field; the new `WhenEnv::new()`
  constructor and existing struct-literal syntax both work.
  Out-of-tree code constructing `WhenEnv { facts, vars }`
  (without explicit `iter`) needs to add `iter: None` (or
  switch to `WhenEnv::new(facts, vars)`).
- `evaluate_for_each` (an `alint-rules` crate-private
  helper) gained a `when_iter` parameter — only matters if
  you've forked the crate.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-04-26

Plugin tier 1: `command` rule kind. Wraps any CLI on `PATH`
into alint's report. Continues the v0.5 monorepo-scale theme
— pairs naturally with `--changed` so per-file external
checks (actionlint, shellcheck, kubeconform, …) become
incremental in CI. Schema-compatible; every v0.5.0 config
runs unchanged.

### Added

- **`kind: command`** — per-file rule that spawns argv with
  path-template substitution (`{path}`, `{dir}`, `{stem}`,
  `{ext}`, `{basename}`, `{parent_name}`). Exit `0` is a
  pass; non-zero produces a violation whose message is the
  truncated stdout+stderr. Working dir is the repo root;
  stdin is closed (`/dev/null`). Output is capped at 16 KiB
  per stream to keep reports legible.

  ```yaml
  - id: workflows-clean
    kind: command
    paths: ".github/workflows/*.{yml,yaml}"
    command: ["actionlint", "{path}"]
    level: error
  ```

  Environment threaded into each invocation: `ALINT_PATH`
  (relative to root), `ALINT_ROOT` (absolute), `ALINT_RULE_ID`,
  `ALINT_LEVEL`, plus `ALINT_VAR_<NAME>` per top-level
  `vars:` entry and `ALINT_FACT_<NAME>` per resolved fact.

- **`timeout: <seconds>`** option on `command` rules. Default
  30s. Past the limit, the child process is killed and a
  violation reports the timeout. Bounds runaway tools so a
  hung child never stalls the whole run.

- **`--changed` interaction.** `command` is per-file (no
  `requires_full_index` override), so it inherits the v0.5
  filtered-index iteration: `alint check --changed` spawns
  the wrapped tool only for files in the diff. A
  `shellcheck` rule on a 200-script repo invokes
  `shellcheck` zero times when the diff doesn't touch any
  `.sh`. Largest practical multiplier on CI cost for
  external-linter wrappers.

### Security

- **Trust gate.** `command` rules are only permitted in the
  user's own top-level `.alint.yml`. A `kind: command` rule
  introduced via `extends:` — local file, HTTPS URL, or
  `alint://bundled/<name>@<rev>` — is rejected at load time
  with a clear error pointing at the offending source.
  Adopting a published ruleset must never gain it arbitrary
  process execution. New public function
  `alint_dsl::reject_command_rules_in` mirrors the existing
  `alint_core::facts::reject_custom_facts_in` gate.

### Internal

- New `alint_rules::command` module (~330 LOC including 9
  unit tests). Polling-based wait loop with 10ms granularity
  for the timeout path; output capping via
  `Read::take(OUTPUT_CAP_BYTES)`. JSON Schema gains a
  `rule_command` branch; root + in-crate copies kept
  byte-identical by the existing drift-guard test.

- 3 new e2e integration tests under
  `crates/alint-e2e/tests/command_plugin.rs` (`#[cfg(unix)]`
  — relies on `/bin/sh`): full-engine pass case, full-engine
  fail case (one violation per failing file), and the
  `--changed` interaction (only invoked for files in the
  diff). 2 new unit tests in `alint-dsl` covering the trust
  gate (rejected from `extends:`, allowed in top-level).

### Compatibility

- Schema version remains `1`. JSON / SARIF / GitHub outputs
  byte-equivalent for configs that don't use `command`.
- Public API additions are non-breaking. `Rule` trait
  unchanged; the new `reject_command_rules_in` is a new
  public function in `alint-dsl`.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-26

First v0.5 cut. Headline: incremental `alint check --changed`
mode for pre-commit and PR-check paths. Schema-compatible;
every v0.4.10 config runs unchanged. JSON / SARIF / GitHub
outputs byte-equivalent for full-tree runs.

### Added

- **`alint check --changed [--base=<ref>]`** and the same
  flags on `alint fix`. With `--base`, the changed-set is
  derived from `git diff --name-only --relative
  <base>...HEAD` (three-dot — merge-base diff, the right
  shape for PR checks). Without `--base`, it's
  `git ls-files --modified --others --exclude-standard`
  (working-tree diff, the right shape for pre-commit). The
  engine evaluates per-file rules against a [`FileIndex`]
  filtered to the changed-set, so a Java license-header rule
  scoped to `**/*.java` skips entirely when no `.java` file
  is in the diff. Cross-file rules (`pair`, `for_each_dir`,
  `every_matching_has`, `unique_by`, `dir_contains`,
  `dir_only_contains`) and existence rules (`file_exists`,
  `file_absent`, `dir_exists`, `dir_absent`) keep full-tree
  semantics for iteration; existence rules additionally skip
  when their `paths:` scope doesn't intersect the diff so an
  unchanged-but-missing LICENSE doesn't fire on every PR.
  Empty diffs short-circuit to an empty report (the
  no-op-commit case in pre-commit). Outside a git repo or
  when `git` isn't on PATH, `--changed` exits non-zero with
  a clear message rather than silently fall back to a full
  check.

  ```bash
  # Pre-commit: lint the working-tree diff.
  alint check --changed

  # PR check: lint everything that diverged from main.
  alint check --changed --base=main --format=sarif
  ```

- **`Rule::requires_full_index() -> bool`** and
  **`Rule::path_scope() -> Option<&Scope>`** on the public
  `alint-core::Rule` trait. Both default to "no opt-in", so
  out-of-tree rule implementations compile unchanged.
  Internal rules override on the eleven cases that need
  full-tree semantics: the six cross-file kinds plus the
  four existence kinds. Per-file rules need no override —
  the engine hands them the filtered index and their
  existing `Scope::matches` loops do the right thing.

- **`alint_core::git::collect_changed_paths(root, base)`**
  helper, parallel to the existing
  `collect_tracked_paths`. Returns the changed-set as a
  `HashSet<PathBuf>` of paths relative to `root`, or `None`
  outside a git repo / when `git` exits non-zero.

- **`Engine::with_changed_paths(set)`** builder method.
  Threads the changed-set through `Engine::run` and
  `Engine::fix`. Every call costs one walk over the
  index entries to build a filtered subset; absent the
  builder call, the engine behaves exactly as before.

- **`Step::CheckChanged`** in `alint-testkit`'s scenario
  harness. Five new e2e scenarios under
  `crates/alint-e2e/scenarios/check/changed/` cover:
  per-file rule skipped when scope misses the diff,
  per-file rule fires only on changed files, cross-file
  `pair` keeps full-tree semantics, existence rule skips
  when scope doesn't intersect, and the empty-diff
  short-circuit.

### Compatibility

- Schema version remains `1`. Every v0.4 config runs
  unchanged.
- Public API additions are non-breaking: `Rule` trait
  methods have defaults, `Engine::with_changed_paths` is
  additive. Embedders that hand-construct an `Engine` keep
  compiling.
- `alint-testkit::Step` gained a variant
  (`Step::CheckChanged`); embedders that exhaustively
  matched on `Step` need to add an arm for it.

## [0.4.10] — 2026-04-25

Three new content-family rule kinds rounding out the family.
Schema-compatible; every v0.4.9 config runs unchanged. JSON /
SARIF / GitHub outputs byte-equivalent.

### Added

- **`file_max_lines`** (alias `max_lines`). Mirror of
  `file_min_lines`: files in scope must have AT MOST
  `max_lines` lines. Same `wc -l` accounting. Catches the
  everything-module anti-pattern.
- **`file_footer`** (alias `footer`). Mirror of `file_header`
  anchored at the END of the file: the last `lines:` lines
  must match a regex. Use cases: license footers, signed-off-by
  trailers, generated-file sentinels. Fix op: `file_append`.
- **`file_shebang`** (alias `shebang`). First line of each
  file must match a regex. Pairs with `executable_has_shebang`
  (which checks shebang *presence*) — `file_shebang` checks
  shebang *shape*, e.g. `^#!/usr/bin/env bash$` to enforce a
  specific interpreter. Defaults to `^#!` (presence only).

  Brings the rule catalogue to ~55 kinds.

- 6 new e2e scenarios covering pass/fail paths for the three
  new kinds.

## [0.4.9] — 2026-04-25

Java bundled ruleset. Schema-compatible; every v0.4.8 config
runs unchanged. JSON / SARIF / GitHub outputs byte-equivalent.

### Added

- **`alint://bundled/java@v1`** (10 rules). Maven + Gradle
  hygiene, gated `when: facts.is_java`:
  - `java-manifest-exists` — `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, or
    `build.gradle.kts` at the root (error).
  - `java-build-wrapper-committed` — `mvnw` / `gradlew` checked
    in for reproducible builds (info).
  - `java-no-tracked-target` / `java-no-tracked-build` —
    Maven's `target/` and Gradle's `build/` not committed.
    Both use `git_tracked_only: true` (the v0.4.8 primitive)
    so a developer's locally-built directories stay silent;
    only directories whose contents made it into git's index
    fire (error).
  - `java-no-class-files` — `*.class` files not committed
    (`git_tracked_only: true`, error).
  - `java-sources-pascal-case` — PascalCase filenames for
    `*.java`, with `package-info.java` / `module-info.java`
    excluded (warning).
  - `java-sources-final-newline` /
    `java-sources-no-trailing-whitespace` — text hygiene,
    auto-fixable (info).
  - `java-sources-no-bidi` / `java-sources-no-zero-width` —
    Trojan Source defenses (error).

  Brings the bundled catalogue to 12 rulesets. The
  `git_tracked_only` rules in this ruleset are the first
  bundled use of v0.4.8's git-aware primitive — the
  `silent_on_locally_built_target` e2e scenario proves the
  wiring end-to-end.



First git-aware primitive lands. Schema-compatible; every v0.4.7
config runs unchanged. JSON / SARIF / GitHub outputs gain no new
keys.

### Added

- **`git_tracked_only: bool`** option on `RuleSpec`, currently
  honoured by `file_exists`, `file_absent`, `dir_exists`, and
  `dir_absent`. When `true`, the rule's `paths`-matched entries
  are intersected with `git ls-files`'s output so only files /
  directories actually in git's index participate. Closes the
  approximation gap documented on the
  [walker-and-gitignore concept page](https://alint.org/docs/concepts/walker-and-gitignore/):
  a `dir_absent` rule on `**/target` with `git_tracked_only: true`
  fires only when `target/` was actually committed, never on a
  developer's locally-built `target/` (gitignored or not). Outside
  a git repo, or when `git` isn't on PATH, the tracked-set is
  empty and rules with the flag set become silent no-ops — the
  right default for "don't let X be committed" semantics.

  ```yaml
  - id: target-not-tracked
    kind: dir_absent
    paths: "**/target"
    git_tracked_only: true
    level: error
  ```

  Other rule kinds currently ignore the field; we'll extend
  coverage as concrete use cases come up. The roadmap'd
  `git_no_denied_paths` and `git_commit_message` primitives are
  still pending.

### Changed

- `alint-core::Context` gains a `git_tracked: Option<&HashSet<PathBuf>>`
  field, plus `is_git_tracked` / `dir_has_tracked_files` helpers.
  External embedders constructing a `Context` by hand need to add
  `git_tracked: None`. The engine collects the set at most once
  per `run` / `fix`, only when at least one rule's
  `wants_git_tracked()` is true — zero cost when no rule opts in.
- `alint-testkit`'s `Given` block accepts an optional `git: { init,
  add, commit }` block so e2e scenarios can stand up a real git
  repo in their tempdir before alint runs.



Distribution breadth. Schema-compatible; every v0.4.6 config
runs unchanged. JSON/SARIF/GitHub outputs byte-equivalent. No
Rust code changes — this release ships new install paths only.

### Added

#### Docker image

- **`ghcr.io/asamarts/alint`** — distroless multi-arch
  (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) image based on
  `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot`. Built by the
  release workflow from the same statically-linked musl
  binaries shipped in the GitHub Release tarballs, so the
  in-image binary matches the tarballed one byte-for-byte.
  Tags published per release: the exact git tag (`:v0.4.7`),
  the bare semver (`:0.4.7`), the `<major>.<minor>` channel
  (`:0.4`), and `:latest`.

  ```bash
  docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/repo" ghcr.io/asamarts/alint:latest
  ```

  Runs as the distroless `nonroot` user (UID 65532). For
  `alint fix` workflows that need to write with host
  ownership, pass `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)`.

#### Homebrew tap

- **`asamarts/alint`** — dedicated Homebrew tap at
  [asamarts/homebrew-alint](https://github.com/asamarts/homebrew-alint)
  shipping a `Formula/alint.rb` that resolves the right
  pre-built tarball for each platform (macOS arm64 + x86_64,
  Linuxbrew arm64 + x86_64) and verifies its SHA-256.

  ```bash
  brew tap asamarts/alint
  brew install alint
  ```

  The formula is regenerated on every tagged release by a new
  `homebrew` job in `.github/workflows/release.yml` driving
  `ci/scripts/update-homebrew-formula.sh`. The script takes
  SHAs directly from the release's `SHA256SUMS` artifact —
  no re-download, no re-build — and pushes via a per-repo
  ed25519 deploy key scoped to the tap.

### Infrastructure

- New release-workflow jobs: `docker` (builds + pushes the
  multi-arch image to ghcr.io) and `homebrew` (regenerates
  the formula and pushes to the tap). Both run after the
  existing `build` / `release` jobs; failures there skip the
  distribution jobs cleanly.
- New script `ci/scripts/update-homebrew-formula.sh` emits a
  complete `Formula/alint.rb` given `VERSION` + a
  `SHA256SUMS` path. Handles both `sha256sum`-style and
  Windows-mode (`*file`) sum lines, errors clearly on
  missing platforms, validates required env up front.
- New test harness `ci/scripts/test-update-homebrew-formula.sh`
  (14 assertions — happy path, asterisk-prefix handling,
  missing-platform + missing-env error paths, version /
  license / test-block shape). Wired into `ci/scripts/test.sh`
  so it runs on every CI pass.



Ecosystem coverage + debugging ergonomics. Schema-compatible;
every v0.4.5 config runs unchanged. JSON output unchanged for
existing commands; SARIF and GitHub outputs byte-equivalent.

### Added

#### Two new bundled rulesets

- **`alint://bundled/python@v1`** (7 rules). Canonical
  Python-project hygiene:
  - `python-manifest-exists` — pyproject.toml / setup.py /
    setup.cfg at the root (error).
  - `python-has-lockfile` — uv.lock / poetry.lock / Pipfile.lock
    / pdm.lock (warning).
  - `python-pyproject-declares-name` — PEP 621 `$.project.name`
    via `toml_path_matches` (warning).
  - `python-pyproject-declares-requires-python` — a
    `requires-python` floor via `toml_path_matches` on
    `$.project['requires-python']` (info).
  - `python-module-snake-case` — PEP 8 snake_case filenames
    for top-level and `src/**/*.py` (info).
  - `python-sources-final-newline` + `python-sources-no-trailing-whitespace`
    (info, auto-fixable).
  - `python-sources-no-bidi` — Trojan Source defense (error).

  Every rule gated with `when: facts.is_python`, so the ruleset
  silently no-ops on non-Python repos.

- **`alint://bundled/go@v1`** (7 rules). Go-module hygiene:
  - `go-mod-exists` — go.mod at the root (error).
  - `go-sum-exists` — go.sum at the root (warning).
  - `go-mod-declares-module-path` — `module <path>` directive
    (error, `file_content_matches`).
  - `go-mod-declares-go-version` — `go <major>.<minor>` directive
    (warning, `file_content_matches`).
  - `go-sources-no-bidi` / `go-sources-no-zero-width` —
    Trojan Source defenses (error).
  - `go-sources-final-newline` (info, auto-fixable).

  Every rule gated with `when: facts.is_go`.

  Brings the bundled catalog to eleven rulesets.

#### `alint facts` subcommand

- New top-level subcommand that evaluates every `facts:` entry
  in the effective config and prints the resolved value.
  Debugging aid for `when:` clauses — quickly answers "did my
  `facts.is_python` actually match?" without running the full
  check pass. Supports `--format human` (columnar) and
  `--format json` (`{facts: [{id, kind, value}, ...]}`).

### Changed

- `alint-core::FactKind::name()` added — returns the YAML
  discriminator string (`any_file_exists`, `count_files`, etc.).
  Used by the `facts` subcommand's renderers; available to
  external embedders.



Supply-chain hardening ruleset + composition ergonomics.
Schema-compatible; every v0.4.4 config runs unchanged. JSON
output gains no new keys; SARIF and GitHub outputs are
byte-equivalent.

### Added

#### New bundled ruleset

- **`alint://bundled/ci/github-actions@v1`** (3 rules). GitHub
  Actions hardening guided by the two OpenSSF Scorecard checks
  with the strongest supply-chain signal:
  - `gha-workflow-contents-read` — every workflow declares
    `permissions.contents: read` at the workflow level
    (`yaml_path_equals`, warning).
  - `gha-pin-actions-to-sha` — every `uses:` across every job
    is pinned to a 40-char commit SHA, not a mutable tag
    (`yaml_path_matches` with `if_present: true`, warning).
  - `gha-workflow-has-name` — every workflow declares a
    `name:` so the Actions UI shows something friendlier than
    the filename (`yaml_path_matches`, info).

  Scoped to `.github/workflows/*.y{,a}ml`, so it no-ops in
  repos that don't use GitHub Actions. Brings the bundled
  catalogue to nine rulesets.

#### Structured-query `if_present`

- **`if_present: true`** option on every structured-query rule
  kind (`{json,yaml,toml}_path_{equals,matches}`). When
  enabled, a JSONPath query that returns zero matches is
  silently OK — only actual matches that fail the op produce
  violations. Preserves the default "missing = violation"
  semantics (`if_present: false`, the existing behaviour).
  Required for conditional predicates like "every `uses:` is
  SHA-pinned" where a workflow with only `run:` steps
  shouldn't be flagged.

#### Selective bundled adoption

- **`only:` / `except:` on `extends:` entries.** An entry can
  now be a mapping that filters the inherited rule set by id
  before merging:

  ```yaml
  extends:
    - url: alint://bundled/oss-baseline@v1
      except: [oss-code-of-conduct-exists]      # drop one rule

    - url: alint://bundled/ci/github-actions@v1
      only: [gha-pin-actions-to-sha]            # keep one rule
  ```

  Filters resolve against the fully-resolved rule set of the
  entry (i.e. anything it transitively extends). `only:` and
  `except:` are mutually exclusive on a single entry. Listing
  an unknown id is a load-time error so typos don't silently
  drop anything.

  Closes the "all-or-nothing" limitation on bundled-ruleset
  adoption that forced users to extend + then restate overrides
  with `level: off` for every rule they wanted to skip.

### Changed

- `Config.extends` type changed from `Vec<String>` to
  `Vec<ExtendsEntry>`. `ExtendsEntry` is an untagged enum that
  accepts either a bare string (classic form) or a mapping
  `{url, only?, except?}`. YAML ergonomics unchanged for the
  string form; existing configs continue to parse as before.



Rule-catalogue expansion + README rewrite. Schema-compatible;
every v0.4.3 config runs unchanged. JSON output gains no new
keys; SARIF and GitHub outputs are byte-equivalent.

### Added

#### Content-family additions

- **`file_min_size`** — files in scope must be at least
  `min_bytes` bytes. Complements `file_max_size`. Picks up the
  "zero-byte LICENSE" case that passes `file_exists` but carries
  no information.
- **`file_min_lines`** — files in scope must have at least
  `min_lines` lines (`wc -l` semantics: every `\n` terminates a
  line, plus one more when the file has trailing unterminated
  content). Catches the classic "README is a title plus
  `TODO`" stub. Both kinds register short aliases (`min_size`,
  `min_lines`) alongside the prefixed names.

#### Structured-query family (six new rule kinds)

JSONPath (RFC 9535) queries over JSON / YAML / TOML documents,
powered by `serde_json_path`. YAML and TOML files are
deserialized through serde into a `serde_json::Value` so the
same path-expression engine applies to all three. Missing
JSONPath matches are treated as violations (conservative — scope
narrowly or relax the path for optional keys); when a query
returns multiple matches, every match must satisfy the rule.
Unparseable files surface a single per-file violation rather
than being silently skipped.

- **`json_path_equals`** / **`json_path_matches`** — `equals`
  compares by value (string / number / bool / null); `matches`
  runs a regex against the string form of the matched value.
  Canonical use: enforce a `package.json` license, require a
  semver `version`, lock a `private: true` flag.
- **`yaml_path_equals`** / **`yaml_path_matches`** — same
  engine over YAML. Canonical use: lock GitHub Actions
  workflows to `permissions.contents: read`, require every
  `uses:` across every job to be pinned to a 40-char commit
  SHA.
- **`toml_path_equals`** / **`toml_path_matches`** — same
  engine over TOML. Canonical use: require `edition = "2024"`
  across every `Cargo.toml` in a workspace, enforce
  `$.project.version` semver in `pyproject.toml`.

#### `oss-baseline` ruleset extensions

- `oss-license-non-empty` — `file_min_size` at 200 bytes on the
  LICENSE, catching zero-byte placeholders.
- `oss-readme-non-stub` — `file_min_lines` at 3 on the README,
  gentle enough to pass for early-stage repos.

### Changed

- **README rewrite.** Replaced the single monolithic `.alint.yml`
  example with a 12-pattern cookbook covering the real-world use
  cases v0.4 now spans: bundled-ruleset adoption, composition
  overrides, structured queries against `package.json` / GitHub
  workflows / `Cargo.toml`, monorepo per-package rules via
  `for_each_dir`, nested-config subtree scoping, auto-fix
  hygiene, fact-gated conditionals, cross-file `pair` / `unique_by`,
  and the security-family bans. Bumped the family count from
  ten to eleven and the rule-kind count from ~42 to ~50.



Composition ergonomics + monorepo support + four new bundled
rulesets. Schema-compatible; every v0.4.2 config runs unchanged.
JSON output gains no new keys; SARIF and GitHub outputs are
byte-equivalent.

### Added

#### Composition

- **Field-level rule override.** Children in the `extends:`
  chain can specify only the fields that change. A common
  override shrinks from four lines to two:

  ```yaml
  # before — had to restate kind + paths to tweak level
  rules:
    - id: no-bak
      kind: file_absent
      paths: "**/*.bak"
      level: warning
  ```

  ```yaml
  # after — id + changed fields are enough; rest inherits
  rules:
    - id: no-bak
      level: warning
  ```

  The loader keeps rules as raw `serde_yaml_ng::Mapping`s
  through the `extends:` chain and field-merges by id. After
  all extends resolve, each merged mapping is deserialized
  once into a `RuleSpec` — a rule that never receives a
  `kind` anywhere in its chain surfaces as a clean error
  referencing the offending id. Facts still replace wholesale
  by id (their kind is a discriminated union).

- **Nested `.alint.yml` discovery for monorepos.** Opt in with
  `nested_configs: true` on the root config. The loader walks
  the tree (respecting `.gitignore` + `ignore:`), picks up
  every nested `.alint.yml` / `.alint.yaml`, and prefixes each
  nested rule's path-like fields (`paths`, `select`, `primary`)
  with the nested config's relative directory. A rule declared
  in `packages/frontend/.alint.yml` with `paths: "**/*.ts"`
  evaluates as if it read `paths: "packages/frontend/**/*.ts"`
  at the root.

  MVP guardrails: nested configs can only declare `version:`
  and `rules:`; every nested rule must have at least one
  scope field; absolute paths and `..`-prefixed globs are
  rejected; rule-id collisions across configs error with a
  clear message (per-subtree overrides are a follow-up).

#### Bundled rulesets

Four new rulesets pulled from a research pass across
Turborepo/Nx/Bazel/Cargo/pnpm docs, OpenSSF Scorecard, and
Repolinter's archived corpus. Buildable on the existing
primitive set — no new rule kinds required.

- **`alint://bundled/hygiene/no-tracked-artifacts@v1`** — 11
  rules. `dir_absent` on `node_modules`, `target`, `dist`,
  `build`, `out`, `.next`, `.nuxt`, `.svelte-kit`, `.turbo`,
  `coverage`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `.mypy_cache`,
  `.pytest_cache`, `.ruff_cache`, `.bundle`, `vendor/bundle`,
  `.go-build`. `file_absent` on `.DS_Store`, `._*`, `Thumbs.db`,
  `desktop.ini`, `*~`, `*.swp`, `*.swo`, `*.bak`, `*.orig`,
  `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local`, `.env.development` /
  `production` / `staging` (`.env.example` is exempt). 10 MiB
  size gate. Several rules auto-fixable via `file_remove`.

- **`alint://bundled/hygiene/lockfiles@v1`** — 7 rules, one per
  package manager (npm / pnpm / yarn / bun / Cargo / Poetry /
  uv). Each uses an `include/exclude` path pair so the root
  lockfile is exempted while nested copies are flagged as a
  workspace-misconfiguration smell.

- **`alint://bundled/tooling/editorconfig@v1`** — 3 info-level
  rules: root `.editorconfig` + `.gitattributes` exist, and
  `.gitattributes` contains a `text=` normalization directive.

- **`alint://bundled/docs/adr@v1`** — 4 rules. Files under
  `docs/adr/` match `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`; each ADR has
  `## Status`, `## Context`, `## Decision` sections. Gap-free
  ADR numbering deferred to a future `numeric_sequence`
  primitive.

Bundled catalog now: 8 rulesets (4 ecosystem + 4 namespaced).
Slash-namespaced names (`hygiene/*`, `tooling/*`, `docs/*`)
route through the existing `alint://bundled/<name>@<rev>` URI
scheme — the `@` separator parses cleanly around slashes in
the name.

#### Config

- **`nested_configs: true`** field on the root `Config` to
  opt in to nested-config discovery.

### Changed

- **`extends:` schema description** refreshed to cover SRI
  syntax, `alint://bundled/` URLs, merge semantics, and the
  `level: off` disable idiom. Old description claimed HTTPS
  was "reserved for a future version" (shipped in v0.2.1).

### Tests

Workspace: 422 → 437 tests (+15). Includes 6 new unit tests
on nested-discovery, 3 e2e on field-level override, 2 e2e on
nested discovery, 4 e2e on Phase A bundled rulesets.

## [0.4.2] — 2026-04-22

Pretty-output overhaul of the `human` formatter. Schema-compatible;
every v0.4.1 config still runs, every JSON/SARIF/GitHub output is
byte-equivalent. Only the human-mode rendering and three new global
CLI flags (`--color`, `--ascii`, `--compact`) are new.

### Added

- **Grouped-by-file layout** — violations now render under a
  dim section header per file (`─── src/foo.rs ─────…`), with
  a leading "Repository-level" bucket for path-less findings.
  Each violation shows `<sigil>  <level>  <rule-id>  [fixable]`
  on one line and the message (optionally prefixed with
  `line:col`) on the next. Policy URLs render as `docs: <url>`
  immediately under the relevant violation.
- **Per-severity summary** — `Summary (N violations): ✗ 2 errors
  ⚠ 1 warning  ℹ 5 info` + `X passing · Y failing · Z
  auto-fixable` + a call-to-action line `→ run `alint fix` to
  resolve N fixable violation(s).` when anything's auto-fixable.
  All-passed gets a concise green `✓ All N rule(s) passed.`.
- **`--color <auto|always|never>` global flag.** Defaults to
  `auto` — honors `NO_COLOR`, `CLICOLOR_FORCE`, and TTY status
  via `anstream::AutoStream`. JSON / SARIF / GitHub formats are
  unaffected.
- **`--ascii` global flag** forces ASCII glyphs (e.g. `x`/`!`/`i`
  instead of `✗`/`⚠`/`ℹ`, `---` instead of `───`). Auto-enabled
  when `TERM=dumb`.
- **`--compact` global flag** switches to one-line-per-violation
  output suitable for editors, `grep`, `wc -l`. Format:
  `path:line:col: level: rule-id: message  [fixable]`, with
  `<repo>` as the pseudo-path for path-less findings.
- **OSC 8 hyperlinks on policy URLs** when the terminal supports
  them (detected via `supports-hyperlinks`). Modern terminals
  (iTerm2, Kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty, VSCode, GNOME Terminal,
  Windows Terminal) make the `docs:` URL clickable without any
  visible change. Older terminals see the plain URL they always
  saw.
- **`RuleResult.is_fixable`** exposed on the JSON output as
  `fixable: bool`, letting tooling decide whether to prompt
  users toward `alint fix` without cross-referencing rule
  metadata.

### Changed

- **Terminal-width-aware section separators.** Auto-detected via
  `terminal_size` on TTY, clamped to `[40, 120]` cols so wide
  terminals don't produce unreadably long rules and narrow ones
  still get some visual fill. Falls back to 80 cols off-TTY.
- **Tightened vertical density** — no blank lines between
  violations within a bucket. Visual separation still reads
  clearly because the colored sigil anchors at column 2 while
  continuation lines indent to column 14. A typical 8-violation
  run drops from ~36 to ~27 lines of output.

### Internal

- New `alint-output::style` module centralizing role-based
  `anstyle::Style` constants, `GlyphSet` (Unicode / ASCII), and
  `HumanOptions` (plumbing for glyphs / hyperlinks / width /
  compact). Swapping the palette is a one-file edit.
- `Format::write_with_options` / `Format::write_fix_with_options`
  added; existing `write` / `write_fix` remain as default-opts
  shims so external embedders compile unchanged.

### Dependencies

- `anstyle` + `anstream` (ANSI styling with built-in `NO_COLOR` /
  TTY handling).
- `supports-hyperlinks` (OSC 8 detection).
- `terminal_size` (column-width detection).

## [0.4.1] — 2026-04-21

Packaging fix. v0.4.0 is functionally identical but failed to
publish beyond `alint-core` on crates.io — the bundled-rulesets
`include_str!` paths crossed the crate boundary, so
`cargo publish` for `alint-dsl` couldn't find
`rulesets/v1/*.yml` when packaging the tarball.

### Fixed

- **Move `rulesets/` → `crates/alint-dsl/rulesets/`**. The
  rulesets now live inside the crate that embeds them, so
  `cargo publish` picks them up automatically. Compile-time
  `include_str!` paths in `bundled.rs` change from
  `"../../../rulesets/…"` to `"../rulesets/…"`. No user-visible
  behaviour change — the `alint://bundled/<name>@<rev>` URI
  scheme and all four rulesets work identically.

### Known leftover

- `alint-core@0.4.0` is live on crates.io (it published
  successfully before the packaging error stopped the chain).
  It's functionally identical to `alint-core@0.4.1` and nothing
  transitively depends on it — safe to ignore or yank later.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-21

Headline: **bundled rulesets**. The single biggest adoption
lever identified during pre-launch review — reduces onboarding
from "write a ruleset" to "add one `extends:` line." Also lands
pre-commit framework integration so any pre-commit user can
adopt alint with 4 lines of YAML.

### Added

#### Bundled rulesets

- **`alint://bundled/<name>@<rev>` URI scheme** for offline
  resolution of built-in rulesets. Rulesets live under
  `rulesets/<rev>/<name>.yml` and are embedded in the binary via
  `include_str!` at compile time. Cycle-safe, leaf-only — a
  bundled ruleset cannot itself declare `extends:` and cannot
  introduce `custom:` facts, inheriting the same safety guards
  as HTTPS extends.
- **`alint://bundled/oss-baseline@v1`** — 9 rules. Community
  docs (README, LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md,
  .gitignore) + merge-marker + bidi-control bans +
  trailing-whitespace / final-newline hygiene (auto-fixable).
- **`alint://bundled/rust@v1`** — 10 rules. Cargo.toml /
  Cargo.lock / rust-toolchain existence, no tracked `target/`,
  snake_case source filenames, Trojan-Source defenses. Every
  rule gated `when: facts.is_rust` so extending it from a
  polyglot repo is a safe no-op outside Rust trees.
- **`alint://bundled/node@v1`** — 8 rules. package.json +
  lockfile (npm / pnpm / yarn / bun), no tracked `node_modules/`
  or common build outputs, Node version pinned via `.nvmrc` /
  `.node-version` / `.tool-versions`, JS/TS source hygiene.
  Gated `when: facts.is_node`.
- **`alint://bundled/monorepo@v1`** — 4 rules. Every directory
  under `{packages,crates,apps,services}/*` has a README +
  ecosystem manifest; unique basenames. Pair with rust@v1 /
  node@v1 for per-package ecosystem checks.

#### Distribution

- **`.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`** at the repo root exposes two
  hooks for [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) users:
  - `alint` — runs `alint check`; non-mutating.
  - `alint-fix` — runs `alint fix`; `stages: [manual]` by
    default so it only runs when explicitly invoked via
    `pre-commit run alint-fix`.

  Both use `language: rust`, so pre-commit builds alint on
  first run — zero install step.

### Changed

- **README quickstart** gains a "Bundled rulesets (one-line
  baseline)" section and a "pre-commit" subsection under "Use
  in CI".
- **`docs/rules.md`** gains a Bundled rulesets section with a
  per-ruleset table (rule id / kind / default level / fix op)
  for every shipped ruleset, plus the override pattern.
- **ROADMAP**: the original v0.4 scope (structured-query
  primitives, git-aware primitives, Homebrew / Docker / npm,
  markdown/junit/gitlab outputs, `command` plugin, nested
  config discovery) rolls forward to v0.5. Bundled rulesets
  moved from v0.5 → v0.4 because they're the largest
  single-step adoption lever.

### Compatibility

- Schema version remains `1`. Every v0.3 config runs unchanged.
- No changes to the `Rule`, `Fixer`, or `Engine` APIs.
  `alint-dsl` gains a new public `bundled` module; the existing
  `load` / `load_with` entry points are unchanged.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-04-21

Patch release fixing a broken `action.yml` that affects every
`asamarts/alint@v0.2.1` / `v0.3.0` / `v0.3.1` consumer. No code
changes to the CLI; no schema changes.

### Fixed

- **`action.yml`** — the `outputs.sarif-file.description` value
  was an unquoted YAML scalar containing `` `format: sarif` ``.
  GitHub's Actions YAML parser recently tightened and now
  rejects the embedded `:` as an ambiguous nested mapping,
  causing `uses: asamarts/alint@<any-released-tag>` to fail at
  job-setup time with `Mapping values are not allowed in this
  context.`. The description is now double-quoted.
- **docs build** — rustdoc's `redundant_explicit_links` became
  warn-by-default in a recent stable; combined with the
  workspace's `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"` it was breaking the
  `cargo doc` CI job. Fixed a redundant link target in
  `alint-testkit::runner`. Affects contributors / anyone
  building from source with the current stable; no effect on
  the release binary.

### Changed

- **Action self-test workflow** now pins `uses:` refs to
  `@main` so it exercises the current action code instead of
  an immutable (and, as of this week, unparsable) `@v0.2.1`.
  The explicit-version test still passes a stable release tag
  as the `version:` input — bumped from `v0.2.1` to `v0.3.1`
  so the downloaded CLI understands the dogfood config's v0.3
  rule kinds.

### Upgrade note

Consumers pinning `asamarts/alint@v0.2.1` / `v0.3.0` / `v0.3.1`
should bump to `@v0.3.2`. There are no API / CLI / config
changes — configs that worked under `@v0.3.1` continue to work
verbatim.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-21

Documentation-only patch release following v0.3.0. No code
changes; no schema changes; v0.3.0 configs run unchanged.

### Added

- **`docs/rules.md`** — per-rule user reference organised by the
  ten families (Existence, Content, Naming, Text hygiene,
  Security / Unicode, Encoding, Structure, Portable metadata,
  Unix metadata, Git hygiene, Cross-file). Each entry has a
  purpose, a small YAML example, and a pointer to its fix op if
  one exists.

### Changed

- **`docs/design/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — rule-catalogue section
  expanded with new family tables (Text hygiene, Security /
  Unicode sanity, Structure, Portable metadata, Unix metadata,
  Git hygiene) and a new Fix operations subsection listing
  every op with its rule-kind cross-reference.
- **`README.md`** — status line bumped from "v0.2 / 18 rules /
  4 families" to "v0.3 / ~42 rules / 10 families / 12 fix ops";
  GitHub Action references updated from `asamarts/alint@v0.2.1`
  to `@v0.3.0`.
- **`.alint.yml`** (dogfood) — expanded from 17 to 32 rules to
  exercise the v0.3 catalogue against alint's own tree. All
  rules pass.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-21

Rule-catalogue expansion. Adds ~25 new rule kinds across seven
phase commits plus one new fix op, covering categories other
repo-linters don't reach: Windows-name reserved words, bidi /
zero-width Unicode scanners, Unix-metadata checks, and
byte-level prefix/suffix. Also introduces the `fix_size_limit`
config knob and short-name aliases for the rules that don't
have a `dir_*` sibling.

### Added

#### Rule kinds (text hygiene — Phase 1)

- **`no_trailing_whitespace`** — flag trailing space/tab on any
  line. Fixable via `file_trim_trailing_whitespace` (preserves
  LF vs CRLF endings).
- **`final_newline`** — file must end with `\n`. Fixable via
  `file_append_final_newline`.
- **`line_endings`** — `target: lf | crlf`; every line must use
  the configured ending. Fixable via
  `file_normalize_line_endings`.
- **`line_max_width`** — cap line length in characters (not
  bytes); optional `tab_width` for tab expansion.

#### Rule kinds (security / Unicode — Phase 2)

- **`no_merge_conflict_markers`** — flag `<<<<<<< `, `=======`,
  `>>>>>>> ` markers at the start of a line.
- **`no_bidi_controls`** — flag Trojan-Source bidi overrides
  (U+202A–202E, U+2066–2069). Fixable via `file_strip_bidi`.
- **`no_zero_width_chars`** — flag body-internal zero-width
  characters (U+200B/C/D plus non-leading U+FEFF). Leading BOM
  is `no_bom`'s concern. Fixable via `file_strip_zero_width`.

#### Rule kinds (encoding + content fingerprint — Phase 3)

- **`file_is_ascii`** — every byte must be < 0x80.
- **`no_bom`** — flag UTF-8 / UTF-16 LE/BE / UTF-32 LE/BE
  byte-order marks. Fixable via `file_strip_bom`.
- **`file_hash`** — assert a SHA-256 digest for specific files
  (rules-as-tripwire for generated artefacts).

#### Rule kinds (structure — Phase 4)

- **`max_directory_depth`** — cap how deep the tree may go.
- **`max_files_per_directory`** — cap per-directory fanout.
- **`no_empty_files`** — flag zero-byte files. Fixable via
  `file_remove`.

#### Rule kinds (portable metadata — Phase 5)

- **`no_case_conflicts`** — flag paths that collide under a
  case-insensitive filesystem (macOS HFS+/APFS, Windows NTFS
  defaults).
- **`no_illegal_windows_names`** — reject CON/PRN/AUX/NUL,
  COM1-9, LPT1-9 (case-insensitive, regardless of extension),
  trailing dots/spaces, and the reserved chars `<>:"|?*`.

#### Rule kinds (Unix metadata + git — Phase 6)

- **`no_symlinks`** — flag tracked paths that are symbolic
  links. Fixable via `file_remove`.
- **`executable_bit`** — `require: true|false`; enforce or
  forbid the `+x` bit. Unix-only; no-op on Windows.
- **`executable_has_shebang`** — `+x` files must begin with
  `#!`. Unix-only.
- **`shebang_has_executable`** — files starting with `#!` must
  have `+x` set. Unix-only.
- **`no_submodules`** — flag `.gitmodules` at the repo root.
  Always targets `.gitmodules` (no `paths` override). Fixable
  via `file_remove`.

#### Rule kinds (hygiene + fingerprint — Phase 7)

- **`indent_style`** — `style: tabs|spaces`, optional `width`
  for spaces; every non-blank line must indent with the
  configured style.
- **`max_consecutive_blank_lines`** — `max: N`; cap runs of
  blank lines. Fixable via new op `file_collapse_blank_lines`.
- **`file_starts_with`** — byte-level prefix check. Works on
  binary files, unlike `file_header` which is UTF-8 text.
- **`file_ends_with`** — byte-level suffix check.

#### Fix ops

- **`file_trim_trailing_whitespace`** — strip trailing space/tab
  on every line (preserves line endings).
- **`file_append_final_newline`** — add `\n` when missing.
- **`file_normalize_line_endings`** — rewrite to the parent
  rule's `lf` / `crlf` target.
- **`file_strip_bidi`** — remove U+202A–202E, U+2066–2069.
- **`file_strip_zero_width`** — remove U+200B/C/D and
  body-internal U+FEFF.
- **`file_strip_bom`** — strip a leading UTF-8/16/32 BOM.
- **`file_collapse_blank_lines`** — collapse blank-line runs to
  the parent rule's `max`.

#### Config + ergonomics

- **`fix_size_limit`** (top-level config field) — maximum bytes
  a content-editing fix will touch. Default 1 MiB; explicit
  `null` disables the cap; path-only fixes (`file_create`,
  `file_remove`, `file_rename`) ignore it. Over-limit files
  report `Skipped` with a stderr warning.
- **Short-name rule aliases** — rules without a `dir_*` sibling
  also resolve under their unprefixed name:
  `content_matches`, `content_forbidden`, `header`, `max_size`,
  `is_text`. `file_exists` / `file_absent` keep the prefix
  because they mirror `dir_exists` / `dir_absent`.

### Changed

- JSON Schema (`schemas/v1/config.json`) gains every new rule
  kind, fix op, and the `fix_size_limit` field. Root and
  in-crate copies stay byte-identical via the drift-guard test.

### Compatibility

- Schema version remains `1`. Every v0.2 config runs unchanged
  under v0.3. The `Rule` and `Fixer` traits gained no new
  required methods; out-of-tree implementations compile
  unmodified. `Engine::with_fix_size_limit` is additive.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-20

Patch release. Finishes the v0.2 roadmap item that didn't make it
into v0.2.0: `extends:` composition.

### Added

- **`extends:` for local files.** A config can inherit rules,
  facts, vars, and ignore globs from another YAML file on disk
  (relative or absolute path). Resolution is recursive with cycle
  detection; merge is id-based with child-overrides-parent
  semantics for rules + facts, dict-merge for vars, and
  concatenation for ignore globs.
- **`extends:` for HTTPS URLs with SHA-256 SRI.** Remote entries
  take the form `https://.../foo.yml#sha256-<64 hex chars>`. The
  SRI is non-negotiable: URLs without it are rejected. Responses
  are verified against the declared hash before use and cached
  atomically on disk at `<user-cache-dir>/alint/rulesets/<sri>.yml`.
  `ureq` is the underlying HTTPS client (rustls for TLS — no
  OS-native crypto linking).
- **`alint_dsl::load_with(path, &LoadOptions)`** for embedders and
  tests that need to pin the cache path or override the fetcher.
- **Action self-test workflow** (`.github/workflows/action-selftest.yml`)
  that dogfoods `asamarts/alint@<tag>` across `ubuntu-latest` on
  four configurations (default, `format: sarif` + JSON-parse
  assertion, `format: json`, explicit `version:` input). Catches
  regressions in the release-tarball → install.sh → binary
  distribution chain that in-process tests don't exercise.

### Security

- HTTPS `extends:` requires SRI on every entry; no
  trust-on-first-use. `http://` schemes are rejected outright.
  Cache entries are re-verified against SRI on read, so a
  tampered on-disk cache fails loudly rather than serving bad
  content. Body size is capped at 16 MiB to bound memory against
  a hostile server.

### Known limitations

- Remote configs cannot themselves contain `extends:` (nested
  remote extends deferred — a relative path inside a fetched
  config has no principled base for resolution).
- The config-wide `respect_gitignore` field cannot distinguish
  "unset" from the `true` default during merge; the child's
  value wins unconditionally.

### Added dependencies

- `ureq` (rustls TLS), `sha2`, `directories`. Release-binary size
  impact: ~+1.5–2 MiB, mostly from rustls' embedded root certs.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-19

Second release. The theme is composition and remediation: cross-file rules,
conditional gating, auto-fix, and two new output formats. Every v0.1 config
continues to validate and run under v0.2 without changes.

### Added

#### Rule kinds

- **Cross-file primitives (7 kinds)** — `pair`, `for_each_dir`, `for_each_file`,
  `dir_contains`, `dir_only_contains`, `unique_by`, `every_matching_has`. These
  support path-template substitution (`{dir}`, `{stem}`, `{ext}`, `{basename}`,
  `{path}`, `{parent_name}`) and nested rule instantiation for per-iteration
  semantics.

#### Facts + conditional rules

- **Facts system** — repository properties evaluated once per run. Three kinds
  shipped: `any_file_exists`, `all_files_exist`, `count_files`. Referenced
  from `when:` clauses and rule messages.
- **`when:` expression language** — bounded recursive-descent parser with
  boolean logic (`and`, `or`, `not`), comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`,
  `<=`, `>`, `>=`), `in` (list or substring), `matches` (regex), literal
  types (bool/int/string/list/null), and `facts.*` / `vars.*` identifiers.
  Parsed at rule-build time; gates both top-level rules and nested rules
  inside `for_each_*`.

#### `fix` subcommand

- **`alint fix [path]`** — applies mechanical corrections for violations whose
  rule declares a fix strategy. Five ops:
  - `file_create` (paired with `file_exists`) — writes declared content.
  - `file_remove` (paired with `file_absent`) — deletes the violating file.
  - `file_prepend` (paired with `file_header`) — injects content at the top,
    preserving UTF-8 BOM.
  - `file_append` (paired with `file_content_matches`) — appends content.
  - `file_rename` (paired with `filename_case`) — converts the stem to the
    rule's target case, preserving extension and parent directory.
- **`--dry-run`** previews the outcome without touching disk.
- **Safety** — `file_create` refuses to overwrite existing files;
  `file_rename` refuses to overwrite a collision; all ops skip cleanly with
  a diagnostic when preconditions aren't met.

#### Output formats

- **`sarif`** — SARIF 2.1.0 JSON, targeting GitHub Code Scanning's upload
  action. Each violation becomes a `result` with a `physicalLocation`
  anchored on the violating path.
- **`github`** — GitHub Actions workflow-command annotations
  (`::error title=...::`). Renders inline on PR file-changed view.

#### Distribution

- **Official GitHub Action** at `asamarts/alint@v0.2.0` — composite action
  wrapping `install.sh`. Inputs: `version`, `path`, `config` (multi-line),
  `format` (default `github`), `fail-on-warning`, `args`, `working-directory`.
  Output: `sarif-file` for feeding the Code Scanning uploader.

#### Testing infrastructure

- **`alint-testkit` + `alint-e2e`** (internal crates) — scenario-driven
  end-to-end tests. 51 YAML scenarios auto-generated into `#[test]`s via
  `dir-test`, 20 CLI snapshot tests via `trycmd`, and 4 property-based
  invariants via `proptest`. See the [ARCHITECTURE / testing
  sections](docs/design/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the rationale.

### Changed

- **Internal workspace crates published** — `alint-dsl`, `alint-rules`, and
  `alint-output` are now published on crates.io. They carry
  `description: "Internal: ... Not a stable public API."`; only `alint` and
  `alint-core` are semver-stable. This change is required so that
  `cargo install alint` resolves its transitive path-or-crates-io
  dependencies.
- **JSON Schema** (`schemas/v1/config.json`) gains the `fix:` block, every
  new rule kind, and the `facts:` + `when:` fields. Root + in-crate copies
  are kept byte-identical by a drift-guard test.

### Fixed

- **`install.sh`** no longer aborts on SIGPIPE when resolving the latest
  release tag. Previously, `curl | awk '{...; exit}'` under
  `set -o pipefail` caused curl to error out with exit 23 after awk's early
  exit; the fetch is now decoupled from the parse.

### Compatibility

- Config schema version remains `1`. Existing v0.1 configs run unchanged.
- The public API of `alint-core` has not been broken. The `Rule` trait
  gained a `fixer()` method with a `None` default, so out-of-tree rule
  implementations compile without modification.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-19

Initial release. MVP.

### Added

- 11 rule primitives — `file_exists`, `file_absent`, `dir_exists`,
  `dir_absent`, `file_content_matches`, `file_content_forbidden`,
  `file_header`, `filename_case`, `filename_regex`, `file_max_size`,
  `file_is_text`.
- Walker that honors `.gitignore`; globset-based scopes with Git-style
  `**` semantics (separator-aware).
- CLI subcommands: `check`, `list`, `explain`.
- Output formats: `human`, `json`.
- JSON Schema at `schemas/v1/config.json` for editor autocomplete.
- Benchmarks (criterion micros + hyperfine macros).
- Static binaries on GitHub Releases for Linux
  (x86_64/aarch64 musl), macOS (x86_64/aarch64), and Windows (x86_64).
- Install script (`install.sh`) with platform detection + SHA-256
  verification.
- Dogfood `.alint.yml` exercising the tool against its own repo.
