## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.2] — 2026-04-22

Pretty-output overhaul of the `human` formatter. Schema-compatible;
every v0.4.1 config still runs, every JSON/SARIF/GitHub output is
byte-equivalent. Only the human-mode rendering and three new global
CLI flags (`--color`, `--ascii`, `--compact`) are new.

### Added

- **Grouped-by-file layout** — violations now render under a
  dim section header per file (`─── src/foo.rs ─────…`), with
  a leading "Repository-level" bucket for path-less findings.
  Each violation shows `<sigil>  <level>  <rule-id>  [fixable]`
  on one line and the message (optionally prefixed with
  `line:col`) on the next. Policy URLs render as `docs: <url>`
  immediately under the relevant violation.
- **Per-severity summary** — `Summary (N violations): ✗ 2 errors
  ⚠ 1 warning  ℹ 5 info` + `X passing · Y failing · Z
  auto-fixable` + a call-to-action line `→ run `alint fix` to
  resolve N fixable violation(s).` when anything's auto-fixable.
  All-passed gets a concise green `✓ All N rule(s) passed.`.
- **`--color <auto|always|never>` global flag.** Defaults to
  `auto` — honors `NO_COLOR`, `CLICOLOR_FORCE`, and TTY status
  via `anstream::AutoStream`. JSON / SARIF / GitHub formats are
  unaffected.
- **`--ascii` global flag** forces ASCII glyphs (e.g. `x`/`!`/`i`
  instead of `✗`/`⚠`/`ℹ`, `---` instead of `───`). Auto-enabled
  when `TERM=dumb`.
- **`--compact` global flag** switches to one-line-per-violation
  output suitable for editors, `grep`, `wc -l`. Format:
  `path:line:col: level: rule-id: message  [fixable]`, with
  `<repo>` as the pseudo-path for path-less findings.
- **OSC 8 hyperlinks on policy URLs** when the terminal supports
  them (detected via `supports-hyperlinks`). Modern terminals
  (iTerm2, Kitty, WezTerm, Alacritty, VSCode, GNOME Terminal,
  Windows Terminal) make the `docs:` URL clickable without any
  visible change. Older terminals see the plain URL they always
  saw.
- **`RuleResult.is_fixable`** exposed on the JSON output as
  `fixable: bool`, letting tooling decide whether to prompt
  users toward `alint fix` without cross-referencing rule
  metadata.

### Changed

- **Terminal-width-aware section separators.** Auto-detected via
  `terminal_size` on TTY, clamped to `[40, 120]` cols so wide
  terminals don't produce unreadably long rules and narrow ones
  still get some visual fill. Falls back to 80 cols off-TTY.
- **Tightened vertical density** — no blank lines between
  violations within a bucket. Visual separation still reads
  clearly because the colored sigil anchors at column 2 while
  continuation lines indent to column 14. A typical 8-violation
  run drops from ~36 to ~27 lines of output.

### Internal

- New `alint-output::style` module centralizing role-based
  `anstyle::Style` constants, `GlyphSet` (Unicode / ASCII), and
  `HumanOptions` (plumbing for glyphs / hyperlinks / width /
  compact). Swapping the palette is a one-file edit.
- `Format::write_with_options` / `Format::write_fix_with_options`
  added; existing `write` / `write_fix` remain as default-opts
  shims so external embedders compile unchanged.

### Dependencies

- `anstyle` + `anstream` (ANSI styling with built-in `NO_COLOR` /
  TTY handling).
- `supports-hyperlinks` (OSC 8 detection).
- `terminal_size` (column-width detection).

## [0.4.1] — 2026-04-21

Packaging fix. v0.4.0 is functionally identical but failed to
publish beyond `alint-core` on crates.io — the bundled-rulesets
`include_str!` paths crossed the crate boundary, so
`cargo publish` for `alint-dsl` couldn't find
`rulesets/v1/*.yml` when packaging the tarball.

### Fixed

- **Move `rulesets/` → `crates/alint-dsl/rulesets/`**. The
  rulesets now live inside the crate that embeds them, so
  `cargo publish` picks them up automatically. Compile-time
  `include_str!` paths in `bundled.rs` change from
  `"../../../rulesets/…"` to `"../rulesets/…"`. No user-visible
  behaviour change — the `alint://bundled/<name>@<rev>` URI
  scheme and all four rulesets work identically.

### Known leftover

- `alint-core@0.4.0` is live on crates.io (it published
  successfully before the packaging error stopped the chain).
  It's functionally identical to `alint-core@0.4.1` and nothing
  transitively depends on it — safe to ignore or yank later.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-21

Headline: **bundled rulesets**. The single biggest adoption
lever identified during pre-launch review — reduces onboarding
from "write a ruleset" to "add one `extends:` line." Also lands
pre-commit framework integration so any pre-commit user can
adopt alint with 4 lines of YAML.

### Added

#### Bundled rulesets

- **`alint://bundled/<name>@<rev>` URI scheme** for offline
  resolution of built-in rulesets. Rulesets live under
  `rulesets/<rev>/<name>.yml` and are embedded in the binary via
  `include_str!` at compile time. Cycle-safe, leaf-only — a
  bundled ruleset cannot itself declare `extends:` and cannot
  introduce `custom:` facts, inheriting the same safety guards
  as HTTPS extends.
- **`alint://bundled/oss-baseline@v1`** — 9 rules. Community
  docs (README, LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md,
  .gitignore) + merge-marker + bidi-control bans +
  trailing-whitespace / final-newline hygiene (auto-fixable).
- **`alint://bundled/rust@v1`** — 10 rules. Cargo.toml /
  Cargo.lock / rust-toolchain existence, no tracked `target/`,
  snake_case source filenames, Trojan-Source defenses. Every
  rule gated `when: facts.is_rust` so extending it from a
  polyglot repo is a safe no-op outside Rust trees.
- **`alint://bundled/node@v1`** — 8 rules. package.json +
  lockfile (npm / pnpm / yarn / bun), no tracked `node_modules/`
  or common build outputs, Node version pinned via `.nvmrc` /
  `.node-version` / `.tool-versions`, JS/TS source hygiene.
  Gated `when: facts.is_node`.
- **`alint://bundled/monorepo@v1`** — 4 rules. Every directory
  under `{packages,crates,apps,services}/*` has a README +
  ecosystem manifest; unique basenames. Pair with rust@v1 /
  node@v1 for per-package ecosystem checks.

#### Distribution

- **`.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`** at the repo root exposes two
  hooks for [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) users:
  - `alint` — runs `alint check`; non-mutating.
  - `alint-fix` — runs `alint fix`; `stages: [manual]` by
    default so it only runs when explicitly invoked via
    `pre-commit run alint-fix`.

  Both use `language: rust`, so pre-commit builds alint on
  first run — zero install step.

### Changed

- **README quickstart** gains a "Bundled rulesets (one-line
  baseline)" section and a "pre-commit" subsection under "Use
  in CI".
- **`docs/rules.md`** gains a Bundled rulesets section with a
  per-ruleset table (rule id / kind / default level / fix op)
  for every shipped ruleset, plus the override pattern.
- **ROADMAP**: the original v0.4 scope (structured-query
  primitives, git-aware primitives, Homebrew / Docker / npm,
  markdown/junit/gitlab outputs, `command` plugin, nested
  config discovery) rolls forward to v0.5. Bundled rulesets
  moved from v0.5 → v0.4 because they're the largest
  single-step adoption lever.

### Compatibility

- Schema version remains `1`. Every v0.3 config runs unchanged.
- No changes to the `Rule`, `Fixer`, or `Engine` APIs.
  `alint-dsl` gains a new public `bundled` module; the existing
  `load` / `load_with` entry points are unchanged.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-04-21

Patch release fixing a broken `action.yml` that affects every
`asamarts/alint@v0.2.1` / `v0.3.0` / `v0.3.1` consumer. No code
changes to the CLI; no schema changes.

### Fixed

- **`action.yml`** — the `outputs.sarif-file.description` value
  was an unquoted YAML scalar containing `` `format: sarif` ``.
  GitHub's Actions YAML parser recently tightened and now
  rejects the embedded `:` as an ambiguous nested mapping,
  causing `uses: asamarts/alint@<any-released-tag>` to fail at
  job-setup time with `Mapping values are not allowed in this
  context.`. The description is now double-quoted.
- **docs build** — rustdoc's `redundant_explicit_links` became
  warn-by-default in a recent stable; combined with the
  workspace's `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"` it was breaking the
  `cargo doc` CI job. Fixed a redundant link target in
  `alint-testkit::runner`. Affects contributors / anyone
  building from source with the current stable; no effect on
  the release binary.

### Changed

- **Action self-test workflow** now pins `uses:` refs to
  `@main` so it exercises the current action code instead of
  an immutable (and, as of this week, unparsable) `@v0.2.1`.
  The explicit-version test still passes a stable release tag
  as the `version:` input — bumped from `v0.2.1` to `v0.3.1`
  so the downloaded CLI understands the dogfood config's v0.3
  rule kinds.

### Upgrade note

Consumers pinning `asamarts/alint@v0.2.1` / `v0.3.0` / `v0.3.1`
should bump to `@v0.3.2`. There are no API / CLI / config
changes — configs that worked under `@v0.3.1` continue to work
verbatim.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-21

Documentation-only patch release following v0.3.0. No code
changes; no schema changes; v0.3.0 configs run unchanged.

### Added

- **`docs/rules.md`** — per-rule user reference organised by the
  ten families (Existence, Content, Naming, Text hygiene,
  Security / Unicode, Encoding, Structure, Portable metadata,
  Unix metadata, Git hygiene, Cross-file). Each entry has a
  purpose, a small YAML example, and a pointer to its fix op if
  one exists.

### Changed

- **`docs/design/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — rule-catalogue section
  expanded with new family tables (Text hygiene, Security /
  Unicode sanity, Structure, Portable metadata, Unix metadata,
  Git hygiene) and a new Fix operations subsection listing
  every op with its rule-kind cross-reference.
- **`README.md`** — status line bumped from "v0.2 / 18 rules /
  4 families" to "v0.3 / ~42 rules / 10 families / 12 fix ops";
  GitHub Action references updated from `asamarts/alint@v0.2.1`
  to `@v0.3.0`.
- **`.alint.yml`** (dogfood) — expanded from 17 to 32 rules to
  exercise the v0.3 catalogue against alint's own tree. All
  rules pass.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-21

Rule-catalogue expansion. Adds ~25 new rule kinds across seven
phase commits plus one new fix op, covering categories other
repo-linters don't reach: Windows-name reserved words, bidi /
zero-width Unicode scanners, Unix-metadata checks, and
byte-level prefix/suffix. Also introduces the `fix_size_limit`
config knob and short-name aliases for the rules that don't
have a `dir_*` sibling.

### Added

#### Rule kinds (text hygiene — Phase 1)

- **`no_trailing_whitespace`** — flag trailing space/tab on any
  line. Fixable via `file_trim_trailing_whitespace` (preserves
  LF vs CRLF endings).
- **`final_newline`** — file must end with `\n`. Fixable via
  `file_append_final_newline`.
- **`line_endings`** — `target: lf | crlf`; every line must use
  the configured ending. Fixable via
  `file_normalize_line_endings`.
- **`line_max_width`** — cap line length in characters (not
  bytes); optional `tab_width` for tab expansion.

#### Rule kinds (security / Unicode — Phase 2)

- **`no_merge_conflict_markers`** — flag `<<<<<<< `, `=======`,
  `>>>>>>> ` markers at the start of a line.
- **`no_bidi_controls`** — flag Trojan-Source bidi overrides
  (U+202A–202E, U+2066–2069). Fixable via `file_strip_bidi`.
- **`no_zero_width_chars`** — flag body-internal zero-width
  characters (U+200B/C/D plus non-leading U+FEFF). Leading BOM
  is `no_bom`'s concern. Fixable via `file_strip_zero_width`.

#### Rule kinds (encoding + content fingerprint — Phase 3)

- **`file_is_ascii`** — every byte must be < 0x80.
- **`no_bom`** — flag UTF-8 / UTF-16 LE/BE / UTF-32 LE/BE
  byte-order marks. Fixable via `file_strip_bom`.
- **`file_hash`** — assert a SHA-256 digest for specific files
  (rules-as-tripwire for generated artefacts).

#### Rule kinds (structure — Phase 4)

- **`max_directory_depth`** — cap how deep the tree may go.
- **`max_files_per_directory`** — cap per-directory fanout.
- **`no_empty_files`** — flag zero-byte files. Fixable via
  `file_remove`.

#### Rule kinds (portable metadata — Phase 5)

- **`no_case_conflicts`** — flag paths that collide under a
  case-insensitive filesystem (macOS HFS+/APFS, Windows NTFS
  defaults).
- **`no_illegal_windows_names`** — reject CON/PRN/AUX/NUL,
  COM1-9, LPT1-9 (case-insensitive, regardless of extension),
  trailing dots/spaces, and the reserved chars `<>:"|?*`.

#### Rule kinds (Unix metadata + git — Phase 6)

- **`no_symlinks`** — flag tracked paths that are symbolic
  links. Fixable via `file_remove`.
- **`executable_bit`** — `require: true|false`; enforce or
  forbid the `+x` bit. Unix-only; no-op on Windows.
- **`executable_has_shebang`** — `+x` files must begin with
  `#!`. Unix-only.
- **`shebang_has_executable`** — files starting with `#!` must
  have `+x` set. Unix-only.
- **`no_submodules`** — flag `.gitmodules` at the repo root.
  Always targets `.gitmodules` (no `paths` override). Fixable
  via `file_remove`.

#### Rule kinds (hygiene + fingerprint — Phase 7)

- **`indent_style`** — `style: tabs|spaces`, optional `width`
  for spaces; every non-blank line must indent with the
  configured style.
- **`max_consecutive_blank_lines`** — `max: N`; cap runs of
  blank lines. Fixable via new op `file_collapse_blank_lines`.
- **`file_starts_with`** — byte-level prefix check. Works on
  binary files, unlike `file_header` which is UTF-8 text.
- **`file_ends_with`** — byte-level suffix check.

#### Fix ops

- **`file_trim_trailing_whitespace`** — strip trailing space/tab
  on every line (preserves line endings).
- **`file_append_final_newline`** — add `\n` when missing.
- **`file_normalize_line_endings`** — rewrite to the parent
  rule's `lf` / `crlf` target.
- **`file_strip_bidi`** — remove U+202A–202E, U+2066–2069.
- **`file_strip_zero_width`** — remove U+200B/C/D and
  body-internal U+FEFF.
- **`file_strip_bom`** — strip a leading UTF-8/16/32 BOM.
- **`file_collapse_blank_lines`** — collapse blank-line runs to
  the parent rule's `max`.

#### Config + ergonomics

- **`fix_size_limit`** (top-level config field) — maximum bytes
  a content-editing fix will touch. Default 1 MiB; explicit
  `null` disables the cap; path-only fixes (`file_create`,
  `file_remove`, `file_rename`) ignore it. Over-limit files
  report `Skipped` with a stderr warning.
- **Short-name rule aliases** — rules without a `dir_*` sibling
  also resolve under their unprefixed name:
  `content_matches`, `content_forbidden`, `header`, `max_size`,
  `is_text`. `file_exists` / `file_absent` keep the prefix
  because they mirror `dir_exists` / `dir_absent`.

### Changed

- JSON Schema (`schemas/v1/config.json`) gains every new rule
  kind, fix op, and the `fix_size_limit` field. Root and
  in-crate copies stay byte-identical via the drift-guard test.

### Compatibility

- Schema version remains `1`. Every v0.2 config runs unchanged
  under v0.3. The `Rule` and `Fixer` traits gained no new
  required methods; out-of-tree implementations compile
  unmodified. `Engine::with_fix_size_limit` is additive.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-20

Patch release. Finishes the v0.2 roadmap item that didn't make it
into v0.2.0: `extends:` composition.

### Added

- **`extends:` for local files.** A config can inherit rules,
  facts, vars, and ignore globs from another YAML file on disk
  (relative or absolute path). Resolution is recursive with cycle
  detection; merge is id-based with child-overrides-parent
  semantics for rules + facts, dict-merge for vars, and
  concatenation for ignore globs.
- **`extends:` for HTTPS URLs with SHA-256 SRI.** Remote entries
  take the form `https://.../foo.yml#sha256-<64 hex chars>`. The
  SRI is non-negotiable: URLs without it are rejected. Responses
  are verified against the declared hash before use and cached
  atomically on disk at `<user-cache-dir>/alint/rulesets/<sri>.yml`.
  `ureq` is the underlying HTTPS client (rustls for TLS — no
  OS-native crypto linking).
- **`alint_dsl::load_with(path, &LoadOptions)`** for embedders and
  tests that need to pin the cache path or override the fetcher.
- **Action self-test workflow** (`.github/workflows/action-selftest.yml`)
  that dogfoods `asamarts/alint@<tag>` across `ubuntu-latest` on
  four configurations (default, `format: sarif` + JSON-parse
  assertion, `format: json`, explicit `version:` input). Catches
  regressions in the release-tarball → install.sh → binary
  distribution chain that in-process tests don't exercise.

### Security

- HTTPS `extends:` requires SRI on every entry; no
  trust-on-first-use. `http://` schemes are rejected outright.
  Cache entries are re-verified against SRI on read, so a
  tampered on-disk cache fails loudly rather than serving bad
  content. Body size is capped at 16 MiB to bound memory against
  a hostile server.

### Known limitations

- Remote configs cannot themselves contain `extends:` (nested
  remote extends deferred — a relative path inside a fetched
  config has no principled base for resolution).
- The config-wide `respect_gitignore` field cannot distinguish
  "unset" from the `true` default during merge; the child's
  value wins unconditionally.

### Added dependencies

- `ureq` (rustls TLS), `sha2`, `directories`. Release-binary size
  impact: ~+1.5–2 MiB, mostly from rustls' embedded root certs.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-19

Second release. The theme is composition and remediation: cross-file rules,
conditional gating, auto-fix, and two new output formats. Every v0.1 config
continues to validate and run under v0.2 without changes.

### Added

#### Rule kinds

- **Cross-file primitives (7 kinds)** — `pair`, `for_each_dir`, `for_each_file`,
  `dir_contains`, `dir_only_contains`, `unique_by`, `every_matching_has`. These
  support path-template substitution (`{dir}`, `{stem}`, `{ext}`, `{basename}`,
  `{path}`, `{parent_name}`) and nested rule instantiation for per-iteration
  semantics.

#### Facts + conditional rules

- **Facts system** — repository properties evaluated once per run. Three kinds
  shipped: `any_file_exists`, `all_files_exist`, `count_files`. Referenced
  from `when:` clauses and rule messages.
- **`when:` expression language** — bounded recursive-descent parser with
  boolean logic (`and`, `or`, `not`), comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`,
  `<=`, `>`, `>=`), `in` (list or substring), `matches` (regex), literal
  types (bool/int/string/list/null), and `facts.*` / `vars.*` identifiers.
  Parsed at rule-build time; gates both top-level rules and nested rules
  inside `for_each_*`.

#### `fix` subcommand

- **`alint fix [path]`** — applies mechanical corrections for violations whose
  rule declares a fix strategy. Five ops:
  - `file_create` (paired with `file_exists`) — writes declared content.
  - `file_remove` (paired with `file_absent`) — deletes the violating file.
  - `file_prepend` (paired with `file_header`) — injects content at the top,
    preserving UTF-8 BOM.
  - `file_append` (paired with `file_content_matches`) — appends content.
  - `file_rename` (paired with `filename_case`) — converts the stem to the
    rule's target case, preserving extension and parent directory.
- **`--dry-run`** previews the outcome without touching disk.
- **Safety** — `file_create` refuses to overwrite existing files;
  `file_rename` refuses to overwrite a collision; all ops skip cleanly with
  a diagnostic when preconditions aren't met.

#### Output formats

- **`sarif`** — SARIF 2.1.0 JSON, targeting GitHub Code Scanning's upload
  action. Each violation becomes a `result` with a `physicalLocation`
  anchored on the violating path.
- **`github`** — GitHub Actions workflow-command annotations
  (`::error title=...::`). Renders inline on PR file-changed view.

#### Distribution

- **Official GitHub Action** at `asamarts/alint@v0.2.0` — composite action
  wrapping `install.sh`. Inputs: `version`, `path`, `config` (multi-line),
  `format` (default `github`), `fail-on-warning`, `args`, `working-directory`.
  Output: `sarif-file` for feeding the Code Scanning uploader.

#### Testing infrastructure

- **`alint-testkit` + `alint-e2e`** (internal crates) — scenario-driven
  end-to-end tests. 51 YAML scenarios auto-generated into `#[test]`s via
  `dir-test`, 20 CLI snapshot tests via `trycmd`, and 4 property-based
  invariants via `proptest`. See the [ARCHITECTURE / testing
  sections](docs/design/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the rationale.

### Changed

- **Internal workspace crates published** — `alint-dsl`, `alint-rules`, and
  `alint-output` are now published on crates.io. They carry
  `description: "Internal: ... Not a stable public API."`; only `alint` and
  `alint-core` are semver-stable. This change is required so that
  `cargo install alint` resolves its transitive path-or-crates-io
  dependencies.
- **JSON Schema** (`schemas/v1/config.json`) gains the `fix:` block, every
  new rule kind, and the `facts:` + `when:` fields. Root + in-crate copies
  are kept byte-identical by a drift-guard test.

### Fixed

- **`install.sh`** no longer aborts on SIGPIPE when resolving the latest
  release tag. Previously, `curl | awk '{...; exit}'` under
  `set -o pipefail` caused curl to error out with exit 23 after awk's early
  exit; the fetch is now decoupled from the parse.

### Compatibility

- Config schema version remains `1`. Existing v0.1 configs run unchanged.
- The public API of `alint-core` has not been broken. The `Rule` trait
  gained a `fixer()` method with a `None` default, so out-of-tree rule
  implementations compile without modification.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-19

Initial release. MVP.

### Added

- 11 rule primitives — `file_exists`, `file_absent`, `dir_exists`,
  `dir_absent`, `file_content_matches`, `file_content_forbidden`,
  `file_header`, `filename_case`, `filename_regex`, `file_max_size`,
  `file_is_text`.
- Walker that honors `.gitignore`; globset-based scopes with Git-style
  `**` semantics (separator-aware).
- CLI subcommands: `check`, `list`, `explain`.
- Output formats: `human`, `json`.
- JSON Schema at `schemas/v1/config.json` for editor autocomplete.
- Benchmarks (criterion micros + hyperfine macros).
- Static binaries on GitHub Releases for Linux
  (x86_64/aarch64 musl), macOS (x86_64/aarch64), and Windows (x86_64).
- Install script (`install.sh`) with platform detection + SHA-256
  verification.
- Dogfood `.alint.yml` exercising the tool against its own repo.
